            Frameworks and APIs Used
        </h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Leaflet.js:</strong> Leaflet is a javascript library used to create the interactive map. It provides zooming,
            panning, markers, popups, and many more features. This allows users to explore the crime map across St. Paul
            easily.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Nominatim API:</strong> Nominatim is an API that is used to convert between addresses and coordinates. 
            This allows users to search for locations within St. Paul by address or coordinates. It also enables the application
            to place markers on the map when an incident is selected.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Custom St. Paul Crime API:</strong> We developed a custom St. Paul crime API in a previous project 
            to help with multiple routes relating to the data. It provides endpoints to retrieve crime incidents, 
            crime codes, neighborhoods, and the ability to insert and delete incidents.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Vue.js:</strong> Vue.js is a javascript framework used to make interactive user interfaces and in this case,
            a single page application. It allows for changes in the map and filters without having to reload the page.
